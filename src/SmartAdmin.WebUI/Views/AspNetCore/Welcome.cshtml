                        After the great success of our previous version of @Settings.App we knew we had to do our utmost best to deliver you the latest and greatest when it comes to Bootstrap based theming.
                        Our journey has not been without challenges and at one point we concluded that the best approach was to completely reboot our framework, not only on how we wanted to setup the template, but also provide a much better customer journey with a strong focus on getting you started quickly, hassle-free!
                        Whether you are a seasoned @Settings.App veteran or a new customer of @Settings.App, we got you covered! And to start off with that we retained the unique look and feel of @Settings.App but brought it up to the newest industry standards, supporting the latest capabilities of your favorite frameworks and plugins.

                    <p>
                        This has been our core motto during the rebuilt of @Settings.App 4.0 and has helped us to stay focused and keep our promise to deliver you a cutting-edge redesign of your favorite Bootstrap template!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Part of the rebuilt was to ensure we would be able to provide better out of the box integrations with the most popular tech-stacks for building web applications.
                        You can head over to the <a href="https://smartadmin-core.azurewebsites.net/info/appflavors">App Flavors</a> page to see our current selection of frameworks that will be made available upon release.
                        You can expect these to grow over time as we include more frameworks that have been requested by our community.

                    <p>
                        @Settings.App 4.0 is built with full support for <strong>npm</strong> packages and uses <strong>gulp</strong> to build the site structure.
                        All of this with a strong emphasis on automation and testing to ensure that you not only get a fully fledged solution but a solid framework that meets our own high standards for both building and writing applications.
